		<h4>But What Does "Full" in Full stack mean???</h4>
		<pre>
			Full means that you develop both the front end, and the back en.
			The front end is what the user sees on what is called the client computer.
			The back end is what is on the server computer that delivers content to the front.
		</pre>
		<h4>What does "Stack" in Full Stack Mean?</h4>
			<pre>
			Stack means that several programs, a "stack" of programs is used.
			On the front end I have HTML5, CSS3, and JAvascript.
			On the back end, I use PHP, and MySQL.
			And I also have a LAMP stack on my comuter.
		</pre>
		<h4>What does <a >"LAMP Stack"</a> mean?</h4>
		
			<pre>
			LAMP is a stack used for our web page server - remember, a server sends web pages
			LAMP stands for:
			L = Linux, which is the basis of our operating system
			A = Apache, which is our web server
			M = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQ:">MySQL</a>, the database we use
			P = PHP, which is the programming language we use on the server side
